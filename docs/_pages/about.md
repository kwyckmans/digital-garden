## About this blog

## About me

I'm a software engineer currently working at [@spotify](https://spotify.com). I mainly do backend development and devops. I have a particular fondness for making the life of other developers easier. I like Developer Experience and tooling. Just don't make me write css, that makes me cry. 

I always like connecting with other people, so feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you want to chat or reach out.

<!-- You've landed in my digital garden: I'll add notes and pages about topics that interest me. Some things may be blog posts, some may be collections (think bullet journal collections[](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/collections) of books, movies, and what not.
<!-- 
You can get in touch with me by [email](mailto:kevinwyckmans@gmail.com), or [twitter](https://twitter.com/kwyckmans). I don't post a lot on the latter one, but I see what's coming in ðŸ™‚.

If you've got any feedback about how this is set-up, or about something I wrote, feel free to let me know, alwyas happy to improve.

There's a [list of all posts](posts.md) planted in the garden. -->
