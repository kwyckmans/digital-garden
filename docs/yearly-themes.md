## The year of stability 2023

### Finding Stability 2023.09.13

I've written this page pretty far into 2023, but I've decided that there's plenty of time left to actually do some stuff, so without further ado. 

A lot of things have happened in the past year or two that were pretty impactful:

* Moved from Sweden to The Netherlands
* Bought and sold our first house (thanks inflation and covid)
* Changed jobs 
* Got fired from said job
* Start another new job
* Bought and moved to a new house
* Diagnosed with ADHD (not that it was new information, but still)
* Got 2 cats and a dog

While my day to day is going pretty okay, I'm very impacted by unexpected things happening. I feel like I could benefit from bringing some stability into my life, as the basis for new themes. 

* Find a new routine that works with the pets and our hobbies
* Get the house out of the "we just moved" state
* Train the pets 
* Get a good work set-up
* Get a good music set-up
* Get music classes rolling again
* Think about what I really want to do and achieve

I'll need to learn about how to best train both cats and dogs, I'll need to do some handywork and a lot of cleaning. For the work and music set-up, I feel paralyzed by thinking about them, so I'm just going to make a set-up, it'll be clear what works and what doesn't.
