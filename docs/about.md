title: Welcome to Kevin's digital garden
---

Hey!

I'm Kevin Wyckmans. I'm a software engineer working [@spotify](https://spotify.com). I primarily know backend stuff, but I fiddle with a lot of different things, and am always interested in learning new things.ðŸŒ³

You've landed in my digital garden: I'll add notes and pages about topics that interest me. Some things may be blog posts, some may be collections (think bullet journal collections[](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/collections) of books, movies, and what not.

You can get in touch with me by [email](mailto:kevinwyckmans@gmail.com), or [twitter](https://twitter.com/kwyckmans). I don't post a lot on the latter one, but I see what's coming in ðŸ™‚.

If you've got any feedback about how this is set-up, or about something I wrote, feel free to let me know, alwyas happy to improve.

There's a [list of all posts](posts.md) planted in the garden.
